Unbranded conceptual illustration for this project. These miniature physical models
communicate the subject; they are not engineering diagrams or photographs of deployed hardware.

| File | Use | Dimensions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [social-preview-v1.jpg](social-preview-v1.jpg) | GitHub social preview | 1280 × 640 |

Both JPEG exports are below 1 MB. The LinkedIn export removes a small amount from
the sides to fit its recommended aspect ratio; the subject is preserved.

## Activate the repository preview

Committing these files does not configure GitHub's social preview.
Open [repository settings](https://github.com/dimaggi-ai/governed-autonomy/settings),
find **Social preview → Edit → Upload an image**, and select `social-preview-v1.jpg`.
See [GitHub's instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/customizing-your-repositorys-social-media-preview).

For a website link, use `linkedin-v1.jpg` as the page's public `og:image`, with
its own title, description and canonical URL. See [LinkedIn's requirements](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a521928/making-your-website-shareable-on-linkedin).
Then check a fresh link in [LinkedIn Post Inspector](https://www.linkedin.com/post-inspector/)
and inspect the actual Featured card. Cached or existing cards may need to be re-added.

## Production notes

Created with Codex's built-in image generation tool. Final artwork was visually
reviewed. Exported with macOS `sips` for dimensions and JPEG compression.
No text, logo, author name, date, neon lighting or performance claims appear in the image.

Style reference: [Network cover](https://github.com/dimaggi-ai/network-vs-more-gpus/blob/main/assets/covers/cover-v1.png), used for materials, palette and lighting only.

Alt text: A copper control path passes through a metal gate before reaching two compute modules.

### Generation prompt

```text
Use case: stylized-concept. Create one NEW unbranded editorial cover, landscape 2:1, preferably 1280 x 640. Reference image 1 is a reference for palette, material and soft lighting only, NOT an edit target. Change the subject completely. This is a conceptual physical maquette, not a production hardware photograph or an engineering diagram.
Look: restrained architectural-journal still life, matte graphite, pale brushed aluminum, warm chalk tabletop, one small desaturated copper or slate-blue accent where meaningful. Natural diffuse daylight, quiet contact shadows, subtle tactile surface texture, precise clean geometry. High oblique viewpoint, complete subject comfortably inside central 75 percent of canvas, generous empty background, strong silhouette readable at thumbnail scale.
Absolutely no text, numbers, labels, words, logos, DIMAGGI branding, author, date, watermark, charts or metric claims. No glowing lights, neon, bloom, lens flare, particles, purple/cyan gradients, decorative circuitry, brains, robots, futuristic cities, glossy plastic or crowded technology collages. Prioritize one clear idea over detail.
Subject: infrastructure actions pass through an explicit authorization boundary. A low graphite control block connects by one flat copper path to two small compute modules; midway stands one elegant pale-metal mechanical gate with a single rectangular aperture. The gate defines a clear boundary; the copper path continues neatly through the opening. The gate is the main subject, with subordinate compute hardware. Avoid padlocks, shields, check marks, stop signs, diagrams of agents, keyboards and humanoid robots. Quiet physical logic in four principal forms.
